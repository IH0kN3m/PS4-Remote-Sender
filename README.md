# PS4-Remote-Sender
A simple GUI app for MacOs that I wrote for my use. Based on flat_z remote package installer project. Written natively in swift, good-to-go tool.

How to use:
* Run remote package installer by @flat_z
* Enter PS4 IP address
* Choose packages to install
* Press SEND
* Press STOP after installation is complete.

That's it! Enjoy :)

Note: Try to use simple package naming, as: Package.pkg for one pkg and Package_1.pkg, Package_2.pkg... for multi-part packages.
ToDo: Add SimpleHttp server as option, as apache may be buggy and needs moving all .pkgs to hosted folder.
